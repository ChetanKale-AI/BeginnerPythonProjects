# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, where the user competes against the computer.

## How the Game Works

The game follows the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
- **Rock** beats **Scissors**
- **Scissors** beat **Paper**
- **Paper** beats **Rock**
  
The user is prompted to choose between 'r' (Rock), 'p' (Paper), and 's' (Scissors). The computer randomly makes its own choice. The game then compares both choices and declares the result as a **Win**, **Loss**, or **Tie**.

## Features
